**One sentence on impact:** In three days, Group 15 is prototyping data stories and decision aids that help water managers anticipate rare hydrologic extremes and plan resilient responses.

## How to use this page (for the team)
- **Edit this file:** `docs/index.md` → ✎ → change text → **Commit changes**.
- **Add images:** upload to `docs/assets/` and reference like `assets/your_file.png`.
- Keep **text short** and **visuals first**. Think “slide captions,” not essays.

## Day 1 — Define & Explore
*Focus: questions, hypotheses, context; add at least one visual (photo of whiteboard/notes).*

### Our product 📣
- Rapid brief highlighting flood preparedness scenarios for Colorado River Basin communities.
- Map-based story showing infrastructure hotspots sensitive to extreme rainfall.

### Our question(s) 📣
- Which basins and communities are most exposed to rare, high-intensity precipitation events?
- How can we blend precipitation frequency analyses with social vulnerability indicators to prioritize mitigation investments?
- What data storytelling formats communicate risk and resilience actions clearly to decision makers?

### Hypotheses / intentions [Optional: probably not relevant if you are creating an educational tool]
- We think that combining NOAA Atlas 14 design storms with updated climate projections will reveal emerging risk hotspots.
- We intend to test whether infrastructure-critical assets align with high social vulnerability scores.
- We will know we’re onto something if partners can quickly point to actionable “next step” mitigation actions from our visuals.

### Why this matters (the “upshot”) 📣
Extreme hydrologic events are becoming less predictable, stressing emergency management capacity. Highlighting the intersection of exposure, vulnerability, and infrastructure sensitivity helps local leaders justify investments in resilient design and community preparedness.

### Inspirations (papers, datasets, tools)
- Publication: [NOAA Atlas 14 Guidance](https://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/)
- Dataset portal: [USGS StreamStats](https://streamstats.usgs.gov/)
- Tool/tech: [FEMA Hazus flood mitigation library](https://www.fema.gov/flood-maps/tools-resources/hazus)

### Field notes / visuals

*Caption: Initial framing of community partners, target outcomes, and constraints.*

> **Different perspectives:** Capture alternative framings from emergency managers, hydrologists, and community leaders—they often surface new leverage points.

## Day 2 — Data & Methods
*Focus: what we’re testing and building; show a first visual (plot/map/screenshot/GIF).*

### Data sources we’re exploring 📣
<!-- EDIT: Link each source; add size/notes if relevant. -->
- **Source A**
- Source B — link and 1-line description

- **NOAA Atlas 14 extreme precipitation grids** — baseline design storms to benchmark current planning thresholds.

  *Snapshot: 24-hour return-period rainfall values for pilot watersheds.*

- **NASA IMERG precipitation time series** — near-real-time anomaly tracking for event attribution.
- **US Census SVI indicators** — spatial context for vulnerable populations potentially affected by flash flooding.

### Methods / technologies we’re testing 📣
- Approach 1 (e.g., time-series break detection)
- Approach 2 (e.g., random forest on features)
- Visualization (e.g., map tiles, small multiples)

### Challenges identified
- Data gaps / quality issues
- Method limitations / compute constraints
- Open questions we need to decide on

### Methods / technologies we’re testing 📣
- Rainfall frequency adjustment factors derived from downscaled climate projections.
- Rapid flood exposure mapping using Google Earth Engine and publicly available elevation models.
- Lightweight dashboards assembled with Plotly Express for communicating uncertainty.

### Challenges identified
- Reconciling spatial resolution differences between gridded precipitation and community-level indicators.
- Limited compute time for running high-resolution hydrologic models within the sprint window.
- Need for vetted narratives that balance urgency with uncertainty when briefing decision makers.

### Visuals
<!-- EDIT: Swap examples; keep file sizes modest. -->
